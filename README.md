# Python Regression Using Anaconda / JupyterLabs

*These are some useful tools and coding tricks I have developed for using XGBoost regression modeling.*

## Regression Modeling
### Reason for XGBoost?
There are many different machine learning algorithms that are used for regression modeling that range in complexity from Linear Regression to more advanced models such as Random Forest, SVM. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an additional learning model which has demonstrated excellent performance for use in regression modeling and has won many data science / machine learning competitions.
